            The Massachusetts legislature consistently receives some of the worst

            We cannot hold our elected officials accountable when they hide behind 
            unrecorded votes. I promise to publish a comprehensive list of my record, 
            with accompanying explanations and reasoning.

            To truly have a government of the people, by the people, 
            for the people, we need every eligible citizen to vote. 
            According to PEW Center <a href={pewVotingData}> data</a>, voting rates are high among 
            people who are registered â€“ the problem lies in the barriers 
            that prevent people from this preliminary stage. Voting is a 
            fundamental aspect of our free society. The state must facilitate 
            easy access to voting with automatic voter registration.

            With long-time politicians dictating the agenda on Beacon Hill, 
            our Commonwealth has become beholden to the will of a few key establishment 
            officials. Term limits for legislators will prevent our public servants from 
            getting too comfortable. We will all benefit from the more regular stream of 
            fresh ideas that fresh faces produce.

            <p>
            At age 19, I started working in constituent services, 
            learning firsthand the value of frequent engagement with 
            constituents. Whether it be securing state benefits, or assisting 
            with insurance, monitoring claims with state agencies, or outlining 
            available services, creating easy access to state resources delivers 
            tangible benefits to constituents. I will prioritize this integral 
            aspect of governance. These individualized interactions illuminate 
            the unintended shortcomings of legislation, providing insight to 
            help us ensure policies actually work for the people. I will fill 
            the current void by bringing a constituent service office to the 
            district, allowing for walk-in assistance and helpful, round-the-clock 
            resources without needing to venture into the city.

            We cannot afford complacent, passive representation at 
            any level of government. We need elected officials who 
            will stick their neck out for their values. I will champion

            the policies that make us proud to call Massachusetts our home.
